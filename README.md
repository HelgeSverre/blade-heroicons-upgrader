## What it does.

> This only supports [Blade Heroicons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-heroicons).

ðŸ”§ Blade Heroicons Upgrader is a Laravel tool specifically designed for updating from Heroicons v1 to v2 in Blade files.
It simplifies the process of transitioning to the latest Blade Heroicons version, making it quick and effortless.

This tool replaces old icon names in your code, such as `@svg("clipboard-check")` and `<x-clipboard-check />`, and
updates them to their new v2 equivalents such as `@svg("clipboard-document-check")`
and `<x-clipboard-document-check />`.

It's built to prevent overlapping or incorrect updates, ensuring that icons are not mistakenly transformed into formats
like `<x-heroicon-o-server-stack-stack />`. It also supports the new `outline` and `solid` variants, so you can easily
update to the new syntax, such as `<x-heroicon-o-server />` and `<x-heroicon-s-server />`.
